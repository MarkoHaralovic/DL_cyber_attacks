# Backdoor Attacks and Defenses  on Deep Neural Networks

This README provides an overview of various backdoor attacks and defenses on deep neural networks, summarizing their key properties and additional notes where relevant.

## Overview

Backdoor attacks in deep learning are a form of adversarial attack where a model is manipulated to respond to certain trigger inputs in a predetermined way, often while performing normally on standard inputs. 

Similarily, backdoor defense in Deep Neural Networks is a methodology to evade such attacks.

## Dataset

All experiments will be conducted on CIFAR-10 dataset.
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class. The training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but some training batches may contain more images from one class than another. Between them, the training batches contain exactly 5000 images from each class.

10 classes present in the dataset are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

## Setup

All dependencies are provided in requirements.txt. Run command pip install -r requirements.txt 
to install requirements to run this project locally

## Running Experiments

### Model training

To train Resnet 18 model, position yourself in the /notebooks folder. In resnet18_train.py set CLEAN to True to train on clean dataset, or to False to train on poisoned dataset, and if doing later, please set the paths to the /datasets folder containing desired poisoned training data. 

Start training Resnet with command:

```bash
python resnet18_train.py
```

To train Efficient Net B0 model, position yourself in the /notebooks folder and repeat process as for Resnet training in notebook efficientnet_v2_cifar10.py, and run command

```bash
python efficientnet_v2_cifar10.py
```

### Fine Pruning

After creating the poisoned dataset, with either one of the attacks (data poisoning or bad nets), position yourself in folder DL_cyber_attacks\defenses\fine_pruning\efficientNet to fine-tune EfficientNet or in DL_cyber_attacks\defenses\fine_pruning\resnet to fine-prune Resnet 18 model.

In config.json, modify the  weight path to the location of the weights file of a model you want to prune and tune. Define the pruning rates, or leave as is to conduct experiment for all rates. Specify which layer to prune in 'layer_keys', or leave as is to incrementally prune all sub-layers in the last layer. Define the batch size for testing, based on your memory availability, and set the learning rate for the fine tuning.

Then, run the following command :

```bash
python Pruning.py
```

In this process, only csv records will be updated. These contain information about the layer, prune rates, accuracy, and both targeted and untargeted attack success rates.

Based on the results of the pruning, decide for a prune rate and the layer to prune, modify those parameters in config.json and run the following command:

```bash
python FinePruning.py
```

Pruned and tuned model will be saved on location DL_cyber_attacks\models.
