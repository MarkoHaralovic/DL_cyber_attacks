# Backdoor Attacks and Defenses  on Deep Neural Networks

This README provides an overview of various backdoor attacks and defenses on deep neural networks, summarizing their key properties and additional notes where relevant.

## Overview

Backdoor attacks in deep learning are a form of adversarial attack where a model is manipulated to respond to certain trigger inputs in a predetermined way, often while performing normally on standard inputs. 

Similarily, backdoor defense in Deep Neural Networks is a methodology to evade such attacks.
